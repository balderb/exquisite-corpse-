# Exquisite-corpse

## King of the jungle

### The lion is the king of the jungle

### Even though he lives in the Savanna

### And has no idea what a monarchy is

<<<<<<< HEAD
*The elephant's wisdom is great*
**just like it's body mass**
*Is there a correlation between wisdom and mass in our universe?*
=======
### _While she swims in the eternal beauty of illumination_

### **The monarch butterfly radiates light to all beings**

### Not flying but swimming through all darkness of daylight

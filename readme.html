    <h1><b>The king of the jungle</b></h1>
    <h2>The lion is the king of the jungle</h2>
    <h2>Even though he lives in the Savanna</h2>
    <h2></h2>And has no clue what a monarchy is</h2>
    
    <h2>The elephant's wisdom is great just like it's body mass</h2>
    <h2>Is there a correlation between wisdom and mass,</h2> 
    <h2>in our universe?</h2>
    
    <h2>While she swims in the eternal beauty of illumination</h2>
    <h2>The monarch butterfly radiates light to all beings</h2>
    <h2>Not flying but swimming through all darkness of daylight</h2>
    
    <h2>Actually, the king of the forest is deer</h2>
    <h2>It also has no idea what a monarchy is</h2>
    <h2>It doesn't bother him at all</h2>

    <h2> The lion is the king of the jungle</h2>
    <h2>Even though he lives in the Savanna</h2>
    <h2></h2>And has no clue what a monarchy is</h2>

    <h4>While she swims in the eternal beauty of illumination</h4>
    <h4>The monarch butterfly radiates light to all beings</h4>

    <h5>It also has no idea what a monarchy is</h5>
    <h5>It doesn't bother him at all</h5>
